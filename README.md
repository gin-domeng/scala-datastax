# Maven build to Datastax Object mapper in Scala 

## Objectives

* Demonstrate how to use the Java Driver object mapper to replace the tedious work of DAO recreation
  in Scala. Reference the
  [documentation](https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/java-driver/latest/manual/mapper/mapper/)
  for details about the object mapper.
* Demonstrate how to model entities as Scala case classes, and DAOs and mappers as Scala traits.
* Demonstrate how to integrate the annotation processor on maven build.
* This project is taken from this repo [GitHub] (https://github.com/DataStax-Examples/object-mapper-jvm) . Thanks to the Author.
